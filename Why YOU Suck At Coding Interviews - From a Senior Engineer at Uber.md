# Mistake 3 - Practicing is Inconsistent
Depth of understanding > breadth
How to know if you mastered something: you know when to use it, but more importantly, when to NOT USE it
Think about the quality/efficiency of your work
Try to OWN a part of your company code, so you are a domain expert on something

# Mistake 4 - Not Fixing your Own Mistakes
It's ok to make mistakes, but not ok to repeat them
Focus on mistakes about application of knowledge, approach, and execution. Not on knowledge gaps, since knowledge is changing all the time. 
Track your mistakes and inefficiencies. Make yourself accountable.
Career: Postmortem process

# Mistake 5 - not seeing how one decision leads to another
Understand -> **Design** -> Code
Ask yourself: why did you make the decisions you did?
"Because of x, I did y"
