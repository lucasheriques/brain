# Making the script
Write it first, then read it.

For code, delete the code (hit backspace) in reverse order, than click CTRL Z to add it.
If not clear what you're talking about, throw an emoji or some other graphic to explain with text

Catchy title and thumbnail is important as well.

# YouTube Algorithm (Fiasco)
Videos between 3-4min. Why? To get good watch times (2:30-2:45).

Then, if you want a video to get viral, make a longer video. That video will get your watch times to be like 2-3x. Then, your video will be recommended much more times.

So, alternate between short videos to increase channel retention time, and a few long videos to overall increase the avg watch time.

To increase engagement, make mistakes. People like to point out mistakes.

Can also make different strategies, like worsening audio/changing volume on some parts of the video to increase engagement (make people ask what you meant).

# Ferramentas blog

Ppl on youtube are searching for entertainment. So, make something informative, but it has to be fun and well-edited as well.
