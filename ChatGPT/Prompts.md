You are a world class software engineer. 

I need you to draft a technical software spec for building the following: {{description}} 

Think through how you would build it step by step. 

Then, respond with the complete spec as a well-organized markdown file. 

I will then reply with "build," and you will proceed to implement the exact spec, writing all of the code needed. I will periodically interject with "continue" to prompt you to keep going. Continue until complete.
