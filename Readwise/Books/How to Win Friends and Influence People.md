## Highlights
- B. F. Skinner, the world-famous psychologist, proved through his experiments that an animal rewarded for good behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behavior. Later studies have shown that the same applies to humans. By criticizing, we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WEAI4E&location=284))
- The resentment that criticism engenders can demoralize employees, family members and friends, and still not correct the situation that has been condemned. ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WEAI4E&location=287))
- When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WEAI4E&location=394))
- Instead of condemning people, let’s try to understand them. Let’s try to figure out why they do what they do. That’s a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness. “To know all is to forgive all.” ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WEAI4E&location=445))
- PRINCIPLE 1 Don’t criticize, condemn or complain. ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WEAI4E&location=448))
- Sigmund Freud said that everything you and I do springs from two motives: the sex urge and the desire to be great. ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WEAI4E&location=457))
- deepest urge in human nature is “the desire to be important.” Remember that phrase: “the desire to be important.” It is significant. You are going to hear a lot about it in this book. ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WEAI4E&location=459))
- Schwab says that he was paid this salary largely because of his ability to deal with people. ([Location 533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WEAI4E&location=533))
- “the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement. ([Location 537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WEAI4E&location=537))
- The difference between appreciation and flattery? That is simple. One is sincere and the other insincere. One comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other selfish. One is universally admired; the other universally condemned. ([Location 593](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WEAI4E&location=593))
- Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself.” ([Location 600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WEAI4E&location=600))
- I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness that I can show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again. ([Location 620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WEAI4E&location=620))
- Let’s cease thinking of our accomplishments, our wants. Let’s try to figure out the other person’s good points. Then forget flattery. Give honest, sincere appreciation. Be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise,” and people will cherish your words and treasure them and repeat them over a lifetime—repeat them years after you have forgotten them. ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WEAI4E&location=623))

- Tomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask yourself: “How can I make this person want to do it?” ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WEAI4E&location=674))
- “If there is any one secret of success,” said Henry Ford, “it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.” ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WEAI4E&location=701))
- The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WEAI4E&location=817))

([Location 1501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003WEAI4E&location=1501))
