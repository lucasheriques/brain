## Highlights
- Becoming a manager is a common, and perhaps default, career step for anyone who can communicate clearly, stay calm during a crisis, and help their colleagues do better work. ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=117))
- I want to have time to dig into new technologies, deeply understand architectures, and learn new technical domains. You get better at whatever you spend time on, and I’ve consistently wanted to keep getting better at technical things. ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=144))
- I’ll unpack the staff engineer role by looking at what I think of as its three pillars: big-picture thinking, execution of projects, and leveling up the engineers you work with. ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=156))
- Big-picture thinking means being able to step back and take a broader view. It means seeing beyond the immediate details and understanding the context that you’re working in. It also means thinking beyond the current time, whether that means initiating yearlong projects, building software that will be easy to decommission, or predicting what your company will need in three years. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=158))
- At the staff level, the projects you take on will become messier and more ambiguous. They’ll involve more people and need more political capital, influence, or culture change to succeed. ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=164))
- Every increase in seniority comes with more responsibility for raising the standards and skills of the engineers within your orbit, whether that’s your local team, colleagues in your organization, or engineers across your whole company or industry. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=168))
- You’ll notice that these pillars sit on a solid foundation of technical knowledge and experience. This foundation is critical. Your big-picture perspective includes understanding what’s possible and having good judgment. ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=179))
- Technical skills are the foundation of every staff engineer role, and you’ll keep exercising them. ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=186))
- But technical knowledge is not enough. Success and growth at this level means doing more than you can do with technical skills alone. To become adept at big-picture thinking, execute on bigger projects, and level up everyone around you, you’re going to need “humaning” skills, like: Communication and leadership Navigating complexity Putting your work in perspective Mentorship, sponsorship, and delegation Framing a problem so that other people care about it Acting like a leader whether you feel like one or not6 ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=187))
- And a lot more. Check out Camille Fournier’s article “An Incomplete List of Skills Senior Engineers Need, Beyond Coding”. ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=311))
- Although most agree that, as Silvia Botros has written, the top of the technical track is not just “more-senior seniors,” we don’t have a shared understanding of what it is. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=323))
- Marco Rogers, a director of engineering who has created career ladders at two companies, has described the senior level as the “anchor” level for a career ladder. As Rogers says, “The levels below are for people to grow their autonomy; the levels above increase impact and responsibility.” ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=360))
- The Medium engineering team wrote a blog post that lays out three reasons titles are necessary: “Helping people understand that they are progressing, vesting authority in those people who might not automatically receive it, and communicating an expected competency level to the outside world.” ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=387))
- As Dr. Kipp Krukowski, clinical professor of entrepreneurship at Colorado State University, says in his 2017 paper, “The Effects of Employee Job Titles on Respect Granted by Customers”, “Job titles act as symbols and companies use them to signal qualities of their workers to individuals both inside and outside of the firm.” ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=397))
- Good decisions need context. Experienced engineers know that the answer to most technology choices is “it depends.” Knowing the pros and cons of a particular technology isn’t enough—you need to know the local details too. What are you trying to do? How much time, money, and patience do you have? What’s your risk tolerance? What does the business need? That’s the context of the decision. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=422))
- Individual teams tend to optimize for their own interests; an engineer on a single team is likely to be laser-focused on achieving that team’s goals. But often decisions that seem to belong to one team have consequences that extend far beyond that team’s boundaries. The local maximum, the best decision for a single group, might not be anything like the best decision when you take a broader view. ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=425))
- To avoid local maxima, teams need decision makers (or at least decision influencers) who can take an outsider view—who can consider the goals of multiple teams at once and choose a path that’s best for the whole organization or the whole business. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=439))
- Just as important as seeing the big picture of the situation now is being able to anticipate how your decisions will play out in future. A year from now, what will you regret? In three years, what will you wish you’d started doing now? ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=443))
- Someone who’s investing in being a good people manager will have less time available to stay up to date with technical developments, and anyone who is managing to stay deeply “in the weeds” will be less able to meet the needs of their reports. ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=455))
- One way to keep a project moving is to have someone who feels ownership for the whole thing, rather than any of its individual parts. Even before the project kicks off, that person can scope out the work and build a proposal. Once the project is underway, they’re likely to be the author or coauthor of the high-level system design and a main point of contact for it. They maintain a high engineering standard, using their experience to anticipate risks and ask hard questions. They also spend time informally mentoring or coaching—or just setting a good example for—the leads of individual parts of the project. When the project gets stuck, they have enough perspective to track down the causes and unblock it (more on that in Chapter 6). Outside the project, they’re telling the story of what’s happening and why, selling the vision to the rest of the company, and explaining what the work will make possible and how the new project affects everyone. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=500))
- TPMs make sure the project gets done on time, but staff engineers make sure it’s done with high engineering standards. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=514))
- When a staff engineer and TPM work well together on a big project, they can be a dream team. ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=518))
- The software systems we build can affect people’s well-being and income: Wikipedia’s list of software bugs makes for good, if sobering, reading. We’ve learned from plane crashes, ambulance system failures, and malfunctioning medical equipment that software bugs and outages can kill people, and it would be naive to assume there won’t be more and bigger software-related tragedies coming in our future.5 We need to take software seriously. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=521))
- When doing it “right” means going slower, teams that are eager to ship may skip testing, cut corners, or rubber-stamp code reviews. And creating good software isn’t easy or intuitive. Teams need senior people who have honed their skills, who have seen what succeeds and what fails, and who will take responsibility for creating software that works. ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=534))
- Staff engineers are role models. Managers may be responsible for setting culture on their teams, enforcing good behavior, and ensuring standards are met. But engineering norms are set by the behavior of the most respected engineers on the project. ([Location 542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=542))
- When senior people vocally celebrate other people’s work, treat each other with respect, and ask clarifying questions, it’s easier for everyone else to do that too. When early-career engineers respect someone as the kind of engineer they want to “grow up” to be, that’s a powerful motivator to act like they do. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=547))
- If a company’s most senior engineers just write code all day, the codebase will see the benefit of their skills, but the company will miss out on the things that only they can do. This kind of technical leadership needs to be part of the job description of the person doing it. It isn’t a distraction from the job: it is the job. ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=555))
- As a staff+ engineer, you’re the counterpart of a manager at the same level, and you’re expected to be as much “the grown-up in the room” as they are. You may even find that you’re more senior and more experienced than some of the managers in your organization. Whenever there’s a feeling of “someone should do something here,” there’s a reasonable chance that the someone is you. ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=569))
- Aren’t technical skills enough? If you’re the sort of person who got into software engineering because you wanted to do technical work and don’t love talking to other humans, it can feel unfair that your vocation runs into this wall. But if you want to keep growing, being deep in the technology can only take you so far. Accomplishing larger things means working with larger groups of people—and that needs a wider set of skills. ([Location 573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=573))

- Your technical judgment will need to include the reality of the business and whether any given project is worth doing at all. ([Location 577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=577))
- As you increase in seniority, you’ll take on bigger projects, projects that can’t succeed without collaboration, communication, and alignment; your brilliant solutions are just going to cause you frustration if you can’t convince the other people on the team that yours is the right path to take. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=583))
- Leadership comes in lots of forms that you might not immediately recognize as such. It can come from designing “happy path” solutions that protect other engineers from common mistakes. It can come from reviewing other engineers’ code and designs in a way that improves their confidence and skills, or from highlighting that a design proposal doesn’t meet a genuine business need. Teaching is a form of leadership. Quietly raising everyone’s game is leadership. Setting technical direction is leadership. Finally, there’s having the reputation as a stellar technologist that can inspire other people to buy into your plans just because they trust you. If that sounds like you, then guess what? You’re a leader. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=591))
- Staff engineering is a leadership role, but it’s also a deeply specialized one. It needs technical background and the kinds of skills and instincts that come from engineering experience. ([Location 624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=624))
- Staff engineers often take on ambiguous, messy, difficult problems and do just enough work on them to make them manageable by someone else. Once the problem is tractable, it becomes a growth opportunity for less experienced engineers (sometimes with support from the staff engineer). ([Location 639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=639))
- When you started out as an engineer, your manager probably told you what to work on and how to approach it. At senior level, maybe your manager advised you on which problems were important to solve, and left it to you to figure out what to do about it. At staff+ levels, your manager should be bringing you information and sharing context, but you should be telling them what’s important just as much as the other way around. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=647))
- If someone asks you to work on something, you’ll bring your expertise to the decision. You’ll weigh the priority, the time commitment, and the benefits—including the relationship you want to maintain with the person who asked you for help—and you’ll make your own call. ([Location 658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=658))
- As a technical leader, part of a staff engineer’s role is to make sure the organization has a good technical direction. Underlying the product or service your organization provides is a host of technical decisions: your architecture, your storage systems, the tools and frameworks you use, and so on. Whether these decisions are made at a team level or across multiple teams or whole organizations, part of your job is to make sure that they get made, that they get made well, and that they get written down. ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=664))
- The more senior you become, the more you will rely on strong communication skills. Almost everything you do will involve conveying information from your brain to other people’s brains and vice versa. ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=674))
- If you’re reporting to a very competent senior person, watching them make decisions, run meetings, or navigate a crisis can be a unique and valuable learning experience. ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=700))
- If you and your manager have different ideas about how you can be most effective, that can cause tension. You can end up with a case of the local maximum issues I mentioned earlier, where your manager wants you to work on the most important concern of the team, when there are far bigger problems inside the organization that need you more. ([Location 722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=722))
- Inside your scope, you should have some influence on short-term and long-term goals. You should be aware of the major decisions being made. You should have opinions about changes and represent people who don’t have the leverage to prevent poor technical decisions that affect them. You should be thinking about how to cultivate and develop the next generation of senior and staff engineers, and should notice and suggest projects and opportunities that would help them grow. ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=738))
- Be prepared to ignore your scope when there’s a crisis: there is no such thing as “not my job” during an outage, for example. You should also have a level of comfort with stepping outside your day-to-day experience, leading when needed, learning what you need to learn, and fixing what you need to fix. Part of the value of a staff engineer is that you don’t stay in your lane. ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=750))
- It’s hard to operate in a workplace where you can do literally anything. Better to choose an area, build influence, and have some successes there. Devote your time to solving some problems entirely. Then, if you’re ready to, move on to a different area. ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=776))
- Yonatan Zunger, distinguished engineer at Twitter, describes the four disciplines that are needed in any job in the world: ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=812))
- On a long-term or cross-organizational project, or with strategy or culture change, it can be months—or even longer—before you have a strong signal about whether what you’re doing is working. If you’re going to be anxious and stressed out on a project with longer feedback cycles, ask a manager who you trust to tell you, regularly and honestly, how things are going. ([Location 861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=861))
- Early in your career, if you do a great job on something that turns out to be unnecessary, you’ve still done a great job. At the staff engineer level, though, everything you do has a high opportunity cost, so your work needs to be important. ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=902))
- Know why the problem you’re working on is strategically important—and if it’s not, do something else. ([Location 909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=909))
- Be wary of choosing a project that already has a lot of senior people on it. Scope out who else is working on the problem and whether they seem likely to succeed at solving it. Some projects may even be slowed by an extra leader joining. ([Location 914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BG16Y553&location=914))
