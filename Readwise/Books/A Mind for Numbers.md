## Highlights
- SUMMING IT UP Our brain uses two very different processes for thinking—the focused and diffuse modes. It seems you toggle back and forth between these modes, using one or the other. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L19ZU&location=468))
- SUMMING IT UP Use the focused mode to first start grappling with concepts and problems in math and science. After you’ve done your first hard focused work, allow the diffuse mode to take over. Relax and do something different! ([Location 751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L19ZU&location=751))
- When frustration arises, it’s time to switch your attention to allow the diffuse mode to begin working in the background. ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00G3L19ZU&location=753))
