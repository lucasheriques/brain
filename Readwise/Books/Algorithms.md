## Highlights
- The primary reason to learn about algorithms is that this discipline gives us the potential to reap huge savings, even to the point of enabling us to do tasks that would otherwise be impossible. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004P8J1NA&location=354))
- algorithm design is an extremely effective part of the process of solving a huge problem, whatever the applications area. ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004P8J1NA&location=358))
- great deal of effort must go into understanding and defining the problem to be solved, managing its complexity, and decomposing it into smaller subtasks that can be implemented easily. ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004P8J1NA&location=360))
- We should not use an algorithm without having an idea of what resources it might consume, so we strive to be aware of how our algorithms might be expected to perform. ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004P8J1NA&location=375))
- best practice in Java programming is to include a main() in every library of static methods that tests the methods in the library ([Location 804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004P8J1NA&location=804))
- • The cost of executing each statement • The frequency of execution of each statement ([Location 3609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004P8J1NA&location=3609))
