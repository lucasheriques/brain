## Highlights
- but check out Nader Dabit’s The Prosperous Software Consultant, Gerald Weinberg’s Secrets of Consulting and Harry Roberts’ Questions for Consultants if you are keen to try that. Yan Cui has published his consulting finances if you want a reference point. (Location 1712)
- When we make mistakes or have great success, we should form them into principles so we can write them down and learn from or repeat them. (Location 2132)
- for one of the 80% of jobs that are never published (Location 2183)
- Learning in Public is not altruism. It is not a luxury or a nice-to-have. It is simply the fastest way to learn, establish your network, and build your career. (Location 2188)
- make the thing you wish you had found when you were learning. (Location 2205)
- understand and accept that you will make mistakes. (Location 2242)
- We’re animals. We’re attracted to confidence and can smell desperation. (Location 2257)
- A poor craftsperson blames their tools. A great craftsperson knows their tools intimately. (Location 2409)
- learn one abstraction level below where you work. (Location 2418)
- A great error message tells you probable causes and how to fix it. (Location 2755)
- You can at least have a hierarchy of errors - a simple info, warning, or error hierarchy will usually do, but you can explore Syslog severity levels for something more formally designed. (Location 2758)
- One way to be a developer that others enjoy working with is to write code others enjoy reading and using. (Location 2767)
- Get straight to the point. Place Installation, Examples, and API docs up front and use a Table of Contents generator to make it easy to navigate. (Location 2798)
- Licenses matter in open source. (Location 2808)
- CI Badges are associated with quality. (Location 2816)
- READMEs are typically written in Markdown, which imposes some strict order on your content, but you can often break that monotony by using some HTML alignment with <div align="center">, or adding a logo or banner (Location 2828)
- Two nice features that are always appreciated: Searchability, and a “Tradeoffs” or “When NOT to use this” section. (Location 2860)
- Even when you are demonstrating how to interact with an API, you can use joke APIs like this one for “clean” jokes or this one for developer jokes or this one for devops jokes (Location 2871)
- Check emptystat.es for more inspiration in real apps. (Location 2906)
- Treat others as THEY want to be treated. (Location 2978)
- You don’t need “the best”, you just need “good enough”. (Location 3004)
- You can achieve more success and happiness when you look for “good enough” and then move on, instead of constantly looking for “best” (Location 3030)
- The easier that data can be obtained, the less valuable it generally is – not because of the relative surplus, but because nobody guards worthless facts. (Location 3081)
- humans also have a built-in aversion to ambiguity and uncertainty, known as the Ellsberg paradox, so we end up clinging on to whatever data we do get, no matter what it is worth. (Location 3084)
- False Precision is not just misleading, it is actively harmful, because it leads to False Confidence. (Location 3086)
- Beyond a certain minimum amount, additional information only feeds — leaving aside the considerable cost of and delay occasioned in acquiring it — what psychologists call “confirmation bias.” (Location 3109)
- First Principles Thinking (FPT) is starting from unequivocal base facts and building up toward some vision or explanation of reality. (Location 3121)
- Having a good grounding in inviolable truths helps you dispel myths. (Location 3145)
- take N facts, put them together, derive a new, more useful fact that is as real as those other facts because it is built on top of them. (Location 3166)
- because if you don’t know how you know what you know, then how do you have any faith in the decisions you make, based on that (Location 3213)
- I think all talks and blogposts in the From Scratch genre, like this on React Router or this on Redux or this on the hardware-software interface is great First Principles fodder. There’s even an entire repo on GitHub for Build Your Own X projects! (Location 3221)
- Writing is a classic example of an adjacent skill, an extra skill you can develop that serves as a multiplier for a skill you already have. (Location 3302)
- “The database is like the universal source of truth, it is where all the data lives about your users and customers… Over time, as you grow, the database can’t respond to all the requests, so you add a cache. This is how most web applications scale. Writing is the cache. (Location 3319)
- Technical writing is a deep discipline with a lot more specialized knowledge than I have space to cover. Google has a great course on (Location 3353)
- You can find more on WhoPaysTechnicalWriters.com. Some other platforms may pay for writing on a case by case basis (Location 3380)
- When you write, you are forced to a definite sequential order - even unordered lists have implicit order. As we write, we give weight to key ideas and emphasize word choice and phrasing. (Location 3444)
- Writing is meditation for the busy mind. (Location 3452)
- writing makes how smart you actually are shine through. (Location 3470)
- Writing things down as they come to you helps you “save your mental state” and defer creating until the time is right and you have enough for something truly great. Writing turns push to pull. (Location 3489)
- Have a place to write: (Location 3510)
- Find time to write: (Location 3512)
- You probably spend a lot of time reading/watching/listening to developer content - take some of that and write down what you learned - otherwise, 99% of it will be gone from your memory and you might as well not have consumed that content anyway. (Location 3514)
- you don’t have to be an expert to write about something (Location 3520)
- Write summaries of things you learned (talks, podcasts, blogposts, books). (Location 3530)
- Write down your standard process for How You Work, (Location 3533)
- Look for questions other people are asking (e.g. on Twitter, Reddit, StackOverflow, etc.) and answer them in your own words (Location 3535)
- First you can start with What topics: (Location 3543)
- Then you progress to How: (Location 3545)
- Then get introspective with Why: (Location 3547)
- Then get more historical and introspective with When and Who topics. (Location 3549)
- What you write is strongly influenced by what you read. Read and do interesting things. Dive down rabbit holes. Go back in time. If you just read the same stuff everyone else does, don’t be puzzled why nobody reads what you write. (Location 3578)
- If you want to do well in SEO, you can try doing TDD: Title Driven Development. Use keyword research like KeySearch to find keywords you can rank for. Then pick a standard title format that you know works because you’ve read dozens of these before (Location 3587)
- Telling a compelling story Relating it to your personal experience Proposing a solution Ending with Practical How-To Tips. (Location 3594)
- The last part of David Perell’s Five Pillars of Writing is repackaging existing work. If the ideas connect, link back to them, or copy them over, or throw them out and rewrite it better. (Location 3607)
- Pick Up What They Put Down (Chapter 19). In the words of Dale Carnegie: “To be interesting, be interested (in others)”. Build relationships one by one instead of spraying your writing to an uncaring Internet and praying it works. (Location 3615)
- Look for a Nexus of Interest, the most interesting topic to you that is also interesting to others (Location 3626)
- Write a million words to deliberately improve from where you are, to becoming the world’s foremost expert on that topic (Location 3627)
- Find something that is most interesting to you, that is also interesting to others. (Location 3641)
- You achieved so much just by writing what people assigned you to write. Now, as an adult, imagine what happens when you write a million words to find, research, and share what you assign to yourself. (Location 3650)
- You just need to find your Nexus of Interest and write and publish more work than anyone else on earth towards it. (Location 3654)
- quantity begets quality (but it doesn’t “just happen”, you have to deliberately improve): (Location 3664)
- Jeff Atwood’s How To Achieve Ultimate Blog Success In One Easy Step has one step: “Pick a schedule you can live with, and stick to it… If you can demonstrate a willingness to write, and a desire to keep continually improving your writing, you will eventually be successful.” (Location 3665)
- His realization: “Slow, consistent progress is the only way to make big things happen”. (Location 3678)
- 500 words of notes on everything you read and learn and watch and listen to (Location 3695)
- 250 words journaling your state of mind and your goals (journaling is a great way to time travel) 250 words of actual writing meant for others to read - documentation, blogposts, etc. (Location 3696)
- When you switch from consume-to-consume to consume-to-create, you naturally spend less time being a passive consumer and more of an active remixer and creator. (Location 3708)
- “Write about what you learn. It pushes you to understand topics better. Sometimes the gaps in your knowledge only become clear when you try explaining things to others. It’s OK if no one reads what you write. You get a lot out of just doing it for you.” (Location 3712)
- It can help to find a community of people going through the same thing as you are. A bunch of writing commitment platforms exist: 750 Words, Diary Email, WriteNext, Commit, Reddit’s No Zero Days, and Writing Prompts, or this book’s own community (Location 3744)
- What do you mean by “put down”? Any new library, demo, video, podcast, book, blogpost, or course that they put out. It is important that it be new. (Location 3776)
- If it’s a new library, go try it out. (Location 3782)
- If it’s a new demo, go read the source code! (Location 3783)
- If it’s a new course, go through it, highlight the top three things you learned. (Location 3785)
- Sketch notes for literally anything are always LOVED. (Location 3787)
- The BIG requirement about any of the above is that you MUST genuinely love/be excited about the thing you’re picking up. (Location 3790)
- being wrong in public will be your biggest source of personal growth. (Location 3801)
- Pick three that interest you and “pick up” on them. (Location 3842)
- Learn the rules of the game Learn how the rules are changing Learn who sets the rules Define your own game (Tip: Invert!) Don’t play games you don’t want to win (Location 3861)
- Working on the right problem dominates speed of execution on a problem. (Location 3874)
- Engineering Leaders can make disastrous decisions. (Location 3883)
- Agency. You own your career when you start being aware of what’s around you and taking control of what you work on. (Location 3891)
- If your job can be modeled by a deterministic request-response loop, you should leave it to machines, because it will eventually be done by a machine. (Location 3903)
- great people can overcome bad strategy when united by a strong culture. (Location 3958)
- When in doubt, specialize. (Location 4148)
- You don’t have to put your full self on display at all times. It can help tremendously to be publicly known for a specific set of skills, while privately you maintain active interests in other capabilities. (Location 4171)
- The rule is basically that when picking a stack for a client project, you’re only allowed to pick one or two new technologies to use, and everything else should be familiar tech. (Location 4240)
- You’re not evaluating things in order to switch - you’re opening your mind to what’s possible out there, so that you don’t get too comfortable with the status quo. (Location 4256)
- Keep a list of the problems you constantly run into again and again. Here’s a list for UI Engineering. Solutions come and go, problems always remain. (Location 4259)
- You’re looking for the core idea, the thing it does differently, and, assuming everything else is fixable (it is), how game changing that would be to your world. (Location 4268)
- In Thomas Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, he shows how almost every significant scientific breakthrough is first a break with tradition, old ways of thinking, and old paradigms. This is why we sometimes call them paradigm shifts (Location 4273)
- If the project maintainers have a track record of running high quality projects, that should be an immediate upgrade in terms of your interest level. (Location 4298)
- Resiliency Velocity Interoperability Simplicity Security Maintainability Performance Compatibility Availability (Location 4323)
- So when betting on a technology, you would do well to get as much clarity as possible on what it values, and to contribute to shaping positive values as you get involved. (Location 4344)
- Even if you don’t care about that, and never intend to be a founder, your understanding of the business you’re in allows you to offer suggestions and prioritize work in alignment with economic opportunity. (Location 4643)
- When the chips are down, Developers are designers and product managers of last resort. (Location 4658)
- In 2011, Marc Andreesen wrote “Why Software is Eating the World” which set out the foundational thesis of his venture capital firm. I am assigning this to you as required reading. (Location 4667)
- serving multiple different types of consumers facilitating efficient value exchange through building and operating a marketplace building a shared set of common standards through standardised internal and external facing APIs (Location 4922)
- ability to generate profits has shifted from companies that control the distribution of scarce resources (Suppliers) to those that control demand for abundant ones (Aggregators). (Location 4952)
- You have the power to both contract your Circle of Concern (aka Focus) and expand your Circle of Influence (aka Competence, Power, Network). (Location 5027)
- Have a primary domain that you concern yourself with (Location 5030)
- Take all the energy you spend on worrying about: the past the future the news what others think whether you might fail and channel that energy into one useful action within your control. (Location 5039)
- example, as a frontend/serverless developer, I have strongly adopted React, whereas Svelte is worth trialing on projects. I think Machine Learning will change our lives, but it doesnt impact me professionally yet, so I am assessing it. I have decided to hold off looking at everything to do with Blockchain and Kubernetes. (Location 5051)
- For Assess, it can be sufficient to just listen to one regular “overview” podcast, like This Week in Machine Learning. Trial technologies are worth looking through docs and demos and trying on new projects. Adopt technologies don’t have to be things you actively use in production, but as a professional in your field, you should be familiar with and have opinions about (eg by going through talks, source code, or following GitHub issues, Twitter threads, or email newsletters). (Location 5054)
- You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. (Location 5062)
- “If you are not thinking about important questions, then you are not going to do anything important.” Keep a short list! (Location 5074)
- Your information inflow should be managed to help you create action. Not quantity of consumption. People brag about how many books they read in a year, or obsessively keep up with headlines (because of Fear of Missing Information). Or you could clip and organize and summarize everything and have gorgeous notes everyone fawns over. Great — if your goal is pretty notes. Optimize for action, not consumption. (Location 5079)
- understand sources of inflated expectations (Location 5132)
- have a process for reality checks (Location 5134)
- Look out for things which are rapidly becoming cheaper/easier because adjacent things will become a lot more valuable as a result. (Location 5185)
- you should want to help technology commoditize, and then you should want to work right next to that technology. (Location 5203)
- Keep a reference counter for technologies: (Location 5230)
- Debounce your Information: Whenever you run into something new, ask: Do I need to know now? Does this information have an expiry date? (Location 5232)
- Understand the value of Information: As a knowledge worker, you need to establish a very strong sense as a curator of knowledge. (Location 5238)
- Make it easy to try things out: (Location 5243)
- Pay attention to Narrative Violations. The term is somewhat debated, but basically when smart people do something quite uncharacteristic, or trends make a sudden reversal, it is a sign you might not understand it fully, and there may be a deeper underlying reason to be discovered. I liken it to Neo noticing the duplicate cat, indicating a Glitch in the Matrix (Location 5251)
- Keep Tabs on Megatrends: Some trends are clearly massive, slow-moving, yet inevitable. You can position for the future by living in the future (Location 5257)
- Megatrends don’t just spread across time, but space as well. As William Gibson observed, “the future is here, it’s just not evenly distributed yet.” Because so many startups start and prove themselves out in the US, and yet take many years before going abroad, the Samwer Brothers have made a career starting clones of successful American startups in Europe and Asia. (Location 5321)
- As far as Developer Megatrends go, one pretty reliable metric is seeing large companies announce that they have adopted a certain technology. (Location 5337)
- Gaming is capturing a LOT more revenue and time than movies, music, TV, and literally any other form of entertainment. The definitive essay on this is Matthew Ball’s 7 Reasons Why Video Gaming Will Take Over (Location 5355)
- The No Code/Robotic Process Automation trend is helping non-developers create commodity software. The fact is the world’s demand for software and automation (100% of the population) greatly exceeds the available supply of developers (0.4% of the population), and a lot of these needs don’t actually require custom, handcrafted code. (Location 5367)
- Software isn’t everything; there are a good deal more interesting “hard” technology trends like the renewed Space Race, Quantum Computing, Carbon Capture, and Plant Based Meat. (Location 5381)
- The beauty of Megatrends is that you do have time to test and observe, so long as you are committed to moving fast once you’re sure. (Location 5390)
- When you can say “I am sure this is going to happen, I’m just not sure if we’ll be the ones to do it”, that’s a good sign. (Location 5394)
- The lesson is clear: it is normal to feel “late” to a Megatrend. Just looking out for Megatrends at all puts you ahead of the vast majority of the population who do not reflect on their place in history. (Location 5409)
- People over Content: Follow people over content sources. When you come across a quality blog, podcast, or talk, notice the person behind it and follow what else they do. (Location 5589)
- Read Good Books Cover To Cover (Location 5599)
- Read Old Things That Are Still Relevant: The Lindy Effect (discussed in Chapter 12) also applies to what you read. (Location 5607)
- One way to measure the quality of what we read is whether or not we are still referencing them 1, 2, 5, even 10 years after we read them. (Location 5611)
- So the solution here is to build up a Lindy Library - an annex of content that has stood the test of time (for example, more than 3 years old and still extremely relevant). You would have more return on your time revisiting this library (or that of others’) than you would constantly scrolling social media feeds. (Location 5614)
- Read Source Code: People often treat the open source movement as “code that I can use for free”, forgetting the premise that it’s also “code that you can freely fork for your needs”. But we are so spoiled that we even forget that it is “code that you can read to learn from masters”. As Ryan Florence has noted, the best way to level up is to “Read source code of stuff you use.” (Location 5620)
- I curated the list of open source React Project Ideas on /r/reactjs for this reason. (Location 5627)
- Have a Goal: You will go further if you put more effort into learning one thing rather than a random assortment, thus diffusing your efforts. (Location 5639)
- “Set a goal to experiment say with a new technology for 31 days. Check it out. See what you think. Write down what you learn.” (Location 5646)
- Up What They Put Down: I have called this “the Ultimate Hack for Learning in Public” (Chapter 19), but of course you can also do it in private. (Location 5672)
- You are more effective if you can summarize the best arguments of all major parties in a way that THEY agree with. This is a non judgmental “schools of thought” mode of learning that I wish more people adopted. (Location 5698)
- Sarah Drasner: Learning to Learn The Ladybug Podcast: Learning to Learn Cory House: Programming Your Brain: The Art of Learning in Three Steps Example Lindy Libraries: Leadership Library for Engineers Essays on Programming I think about a lot Chris Coyier’s Timeless Web Dev Articles (Location 5712)
- “I don’t consider myself a designer. I consider myself a developer who can design… I create designs so that people are interested in my code.” - Sarah Drasner (Location 5726)
- Next, you should be familiar with the simple CSS incantations that make common layout paradigms - CSSLayout and Every Layout are the definitive resources you can use. In particular, the Holy Grail layout is so named because it is so common for apps and sites. (Location 5779)
- Gradients only require a few lines of CSS, so have great performance. You can generate good background gradients with free tools like WebGradients, UI Gradients, and Gradient Animator (Location 5834)
- On the larger end of the scale, you can draw on free illustration resources for your marketing pages and empty states. (Location 5852)
- For doing your own graphics, Canva and Snappa are the market leading free tools for non-designers to do basic graphic design. (Location 5857)
- Here are the canonical, extremely well known resources you should check out: (Location 5890)
- Beyond a certain level you are not being paid to have the right answers - that’s what your reports are for. It’s your job to ask the right questions, and to enable your team to figure out how to get the answers. (Location 5917)
- senior levels you are not expected to know everything, and that’s an interesting violation of “Knowledge is Power”. (Location 5926)
- Showing that I readily admit ignorance did help increase my credibility for when I did say I knew something, because I had demonstrated that I had no problem professing ignorance. This increased trust on my team. (Location 5955)
- As a first time speaker, your best opportunities are to apply to multi-track, multi-day conferences that have committed to a “blind” CFP review process, around a framework or language or architecture you know well. (Location 6097)
- You should especially seek out conferences that put out high quality videos of every talk. (Location 6100)
- Developers always want easy ways to add design touches without being a designer. (Location 6121)
- If you need ideas, think about which of your experiences overlap with hot topics. (Location 6122)
- Everyone has the same insecurities and in a way you are there to satisfy their insecurities. Conference organizers look to other conferences for inspiration, and so should you. (Location 6124)
- The reality is that the ultimate customers of conferences are the bosses of the people attending conferences. They want to see some “I can use this at work” return on investment on sending their employees. (Location 6148)
- Developers are always looking for more inspiration on how their tech reaches out to the “real world”, because most of us spend all day working on SaaS apps and marketing pages. (Location 6156)
- The War Story: This is a great first talk genre for someone with some work experience. You simply tell a story of something you went through at work, including setbacks, lessons learned, and ESPECIALLY any quantitative benefits gained. (Location 6162)
- But I name this genre more broadly because you can also think of other fundamentals to teach, like the JS Event Loop, Visual Design or Game Programming Techniques. (Location 6197)
- Appeal to what people will get out of your talk rather than the specifics of how to get there (Location 6272)
- To get ideas you can check out Ideaswatch, or you can simply look for problems to solve at work. (Location 6568)
- Start small and break it up (Location 6573)
- However, don’t limit your projects to things you already know. It is good to practice having to learn on demand too. (Location 6592)
- Consistency and Momentum are King. (Location 6594)
- Have an end date. (Location 6599)
- One great “forcing function” for you to ship your project and get closure is to commit to giving a live demo or talk at a meetup or some other event in the near future. Not everyone responds well to this kind of pressure! (Location 6603)
- “Fixed deadline, negotiable scope” has to be the most underrated pattern in product management. It’s the secret to shipping. - Ryan Singer (Location 6606)
- Check Multiple Boxes. In Sarah Drasner’s timeless post on Prioritizing, she advocates picking projects based on whether it helps to fulfil multiple goals at once. If you have four areas of concern, like community, mentorship, money, and personal fulfilment, then picking a project at the intersection of two or more of those areas can have higher mileage for your time. (Location 6609)
- I mute the nitpickers, block the outraged, like the kind, follow the insightful. - Naval Ravikant (Location 6758)
- “Make something interesting in real life, and go share it where people are interested in what you did.” (Location 6811)
- There are a great number of other ways you can be helpful on the Internet: (Location 6814)
- A high-quality tweet: Is on a topic you have credibility on. Is on a topic that interests your audience. Is on a topic that interests you. Is about something you experienced. Has concrete details rather than abstract. Doesn’t ask for anything. (Location 6825)
- And be patient - you are building a network that will be with you an entire career, and maybe lifetime. Your Twitter relationships will probably outlast any job. Invest accordingly. (Location 6985)
- I know exactly which parts of me spark interest and conversation without going too off track. Therefore I can sustain interest and conversation longer, and in exchange, people know when to call on me. You should keep a list too — know your strengths and unfair advantages. (Location 7068)
- I recommend taking consistency to an extreme level. (Location 7124)
- You get there by planting a flag on your domain, and saying, “this is what I do” (Location 7191)
- find an area that is important but under-owned and become everyone’s go-to expert on that topic. (Location 7200)
- Find something within what you love, that you are ABSURDLY unsatisfied with. That love-hate tension can fuel you for years. (Location 7211)
- Picking your domain is 90% of the journey. Most people don’t even get that far. To really clean up, be prolific around that domain. Show up. To every conversation. I call this “High Availability for Humans”. (Location 7217)
- Your goal, as a brand, is to make it into everyone’s consideration set. You do that by being Highly Available. (Location 7226)
- but it can be worth it to make the Faustian bargain of growing faster on a platform (like Twitter) first, then pivoting that to your blog/mailing list once you have some reach. Growing a blog/mailing list from zero with no other presence is hard. (Location 7260)
- Have at your fingertips all the relevant statistics, data, quotes, and anecdotes for when you solved major product pain points, or contributed a major revenue generating/cost saving feature. Julia Evans calls this a Brag Document (Location 7269)
- Consider this “applied personal branding” — You’ll know you’ve succeeded when your boss is able to repeat everything you say you’ve done to her boss, to advocate for you as full-throatedly as you should do yourself. (Location 7276)
- The best Cool Shit will be stuff you have been paid money for and put in production, and that people can go check out live. (Location 7311)
- The better you have a handle on your Personal Brand, your Domain, your Business Value or your Coding Skills, the easier time you will have marketing in public. (Location 7337)
- recommend Leil Lowndes’ How to Talk To Anyone for great tips on this. (Location 7467)
- Visualize your work. If you draw, you can be WORLD BEATING at marketing. (Location 7490)
- Summarize the top three books in your field for your blog. This idea is often attributed to Tim Ferriss, but I’m sure multiple people have come up with it. (Location 7504)
- Further Reading: flawless app’s Marketing for Engineers repo - a hand-picked collection of resources for solving practical marketing tasks, like finding beta testers, growing first user base, advertising project without a budget, and scaling marketing activities for building constant revenue streams. (Location 7511)
- That’s where your underlying Habits come in. If your Principles, Strategies and Tactics operate at the conscious level, then your Habits work on your subconscious. (Location 7541)
- Whatever you choose, whether open sourcing your knowledge, speaking at conferences, or marketing yourself, will help. (Location 7605)
- Learning in Public is so powerful precisely because it lets you do both Storage and Networking at the same time, with a built-in infinite feedback loop. (Location 7607)
- Get control of your schedule. Create a single source of truth (per category), put everything in it, and make time for things that matter. (Location 7622)
- Almost every endeavor of lasting, long term value is Not Urgent, yet Important. If time is more valuable than money, then the skill of making time is more valuable than the skill of making money. Learn to make time. (Location 7634)
- Strategy matters. Make time for the big strategic decisions in your life. Time is uneven – Some years will pass like days, but some days will feel like years. You can’t control when your big career breaks will happen, but you can periodically step back to reassess the big picture, everything from Business Strategy to industry Megatrends to how you are progressing on Career Ladders. Luck will favor the prepared mind. (Location 7640)
- When you do work also matters. Your focus and energy do not stay constant at all times of the day. The science of chronotypes has found widespread acceptance and it is worth figuring out which you are (Location 7644)
- tirelessly, we will be rewarded with friendly praise, high grades, and good paychecks. Slowly, we lose more and more (Location 7666)
- But for our context, we just focused on four categories of habits: Firmware: Mental and Physical Health External Devices: Writing, Networking, and Environment Scheduler: Prioritization and Scheduling Kernel: Drive (Location 7683)
