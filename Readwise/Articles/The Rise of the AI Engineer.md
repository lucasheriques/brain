## Highlights
- **Foundation Models** are “[few shot learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)”, exhibiting [in-context learning](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1627366413840322562?s=20) and even [zero shot transfer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.02643.pdf) capabilities that generalize beyond the original intent of model trainers. In other words, *the people creating the models don’t fully know what they are capable of*. People who *aren’t* LLM researchers are able to find and exploit capabilities simply by spending more time with the models, and applying them to a domain that is undervalued by research (e.g. Jasper with copywriting).

- **Microsoft, Google, Meta, and the large Foundation Model labs have cornered scarce research talent** to essentially deliver “AI Research as a Service” APIs. You can’t hire them, but you can rent them — if you have software engineers on the other end who know how to work with them. There are ~5000 LLM researchers in the world, but ~50m software engineers. Supply constraints dictate that an “in-between” class of AI Engineers will rise to meet demand. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h49abze06h3b6axsnxnkr5a1))
- **Fire, ready, aim.** Instead of requiring *data scientists/ML engineers* do a laborious data collection exercise before training a single domain specific model that is then put into production, a *product manager/software engineer* can prompt an LLM, and build/validate a product idea, before getting specific data to finetune.

  Let’s say there are 100-1000x more of the latter than the former, and the “fire, ready, aim” workflow of prompted LLM prototypes lets you move 10-100x faster than traditional ML. So AI Engineers will be able to validate AI products say 1,000-10,000x cheaper. It’s Waterfall vs Agile, all over again. AI is Agile.
