## Highlights
- When you build a new system from scratch, you have the opportunity to introduce order from the beginning, with clear responsibility boundaries and well-defined interfaces. You can start with a master design plan and build components top-down. When you have a legacy system that has accumulated components over time, you get the London system. When examining a legacy architecture, you'll discover quirks and wonder why they exist. And when you do a deep dive, there is usually a good reason for them. There might be many of these quirks, which, in totality, make it difficult to understand, navigate, and extend. As much as a developer would like to rewrite everything about a big system to modernize it and improve its layout, sometimes it's just not possible or worth the effort, in the same way that putting an American-style grid system over London is not feasible.

    - Note: The text describes the advantages of building a new system from scratch, such as the ability to introduce clear boundaries and interfaces. It contrasts this with the difficulties of working with a legacy system that has accumulated quirks and components over time, which can make it hard to understand, navigate, and extend. Although it might be tempting to rewrite an entire big system to modernize it, sometimes it's not worth the effort, just like imposing an American-style grid system over London wouldn't be feasible.
- And so with my work trip in New York, as we try to to align multiple systems who’s bases are just a bit off from each other, with systems that have accreted quirky things over time, I realized that things are going to be messy and non-optimal. There simply isn’t a perfect solution to be had. And just like me getting mad about not being able to navigate in my own city, I just need to accept that it is a small price to pay for a connected city.

    - Note: The author is acknowledging that aligning multiple systems that have developed quirks over time can be messy and non-optimal, and there is no perfect solution. They use their frustration with navigating their own city as an example of accepting the small price of having a connected city.
