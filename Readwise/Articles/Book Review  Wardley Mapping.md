## Highlights
- We had no map of the environment, no visual means of describing the battle at hand and hence no understanding of our context. Without maps, I didn’t seem to have any effective mechanism of learning from one encounter to the next or even a mechanism of effective communication ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2zwbk1816cqcht3t3r9v5c9))
- • First, the process of **strategy is not a linear process but an iterative cycle**. The climate may affect your purpose, the environment may affect your strategy and your actions may affect all. Second, acting is essential to learning. Lastly your purpose isn’t fixed, it changes as your landscape changes and as you act. There is no “core”, it’s all transitional.

    - Note: This excerpt explains that the process of strategy is not a straightforward path, but rather an ongoing cycle that is affected by various factors such as the environment and actions taken. Taking action is important for learning and one's purpose is not set in stone, but instead changes in response to changes in the environment and one's actions. There is no fixed "core," as everything is constantly evolving.
