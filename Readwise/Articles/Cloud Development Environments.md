## Highlights
- **Large codebases come with slow build and test times, which is why CDEs make sense as an alternative.** There are plenty of examples of companies which opted to introduce cloud development environments, and one feature they all share is their ever-growing codebases. Building the code from scratch can take more than 10 minutes on a powerful developer machine, while running automated tests for the codebase may take even longer.

- The rise of Cloud-based development environments (CDEs) and developing remotely are very recent trends, and their adoption seems to be accelerating at many large tech companies, and some medium-sized ones, too.
  It’s interesting to observe that many companies opt to build their own solution, and in today’s article, we’ve explored how Pipedrive, Uber and Slack went about this. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4a8mmzj17dzjhwprfqvc1zb))
