## Highlights
- The idea is that you need all three types, in a cycle with handoffs from one team to another, to support sustaining long-term innovation. No team should do everything because the skills that make you good at being a pioneer may make you a poor town planner, and vice versa. The dynamic in this metaphor is part of the reason I think acquiring the skill of system design is so difficult, and why it’s so valuable for employers.

- Pioneer teams venture into unknown territory, settler teams take those ideas and flesh them out to make them real, and town planner teams refine those ideas so they work for users at scale. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2y1paaqppdsgn0ap5gc8bhd))
- Every city started off with pioneers who decided that this might be a good place to stop for a bit. Word soon gets out to settlers who start to flock in, but now there needs to be roads, rules, and a bit of order. Once you’ve become a full-fledged city, you need things like zoning systems, sewers, trash collection services, and mass transit.

- When you join an engineering team, it makes a lot of sense to understand what phase your settlement is currently in, what it is growing into (if it is growing at all), and to act accordingly. You may not need to build in fancy new concepts to scale out your application because you may be in the prototyping or initial release phase. Alternatively, the project may be a bit more mature but not have a lot of concurrent users, in which case a simple web app that connects to a small data store is fine, and it will be fine indefinitely. Not every village turns into a mega-city. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2y277582rcsk9s2cgc61q5b))
- Big distributed systems are marvels to witness from the inside, but they aren’t all rainbows and unicorns. A feature that would take a week at a scrappy startup might take an entire year at a larger shop, not because the engineers are of lower caliber, but because rerouting a road in the countryside with nothing around it is much different than doing it in a big, built-up city.

- The skill of high-scale system design is valuable to employers because there are limited pathways to acquiring these skills. If these are skills and experience you want to acquire, my advice would be to gain book-level knowledge and do your best to expose yourself to larger and larger setups.

    - Note: find a job at a company that is doing high scale, join an adjacent role so you can get exposure. acquiring system design skills has an incredible ROI, and the first step is understanding why are they so hard to get
