Prioritize 2* units
Prioritize units harmony (2* main tank, carry, etc)
Don't be too precious with items

Good early items: sunfire, guinsoo, warmog, titans resolve, bramble vest, gargoyle if strong 2 star tank, deathblade, thieves gloves

Bad early items: zephyr, shroud, QSS (almost no CC early), redemption (units dont have lots of health), giant slayer (cant proc the 60% bonus, but very good late game)

If need frontline: locket or zz rot
If need damage: ionic spark, shiv or morello
Flex items: HOJ, dragonclaw, zekes, trap claw
Items for AP: bb, shojin, rabadons, hextech, archangels

Playing with no items is asking for going bot 8

# Econ tips

## Fast 8

Try to not get lower than 30g stage 3
If you have a streak before a PvE round, try to keep it since the bonus will be gained in the next two rounds
Get 50g ASAP

### Stage 1
If you get: 3 comps + gold or 2 comps + gold + neekos: dont try to make 10g during stage 1
If you get: 1 or 2 comps + gold: try to make 10g during stage 1-2 or 1-3

At 1-4, decide if you want to pre level to 4. Want to do that if you're looking for a specific 3-cost, or lots of 2* units so you can add one impactul unit to win streak. Don't pre-level to 4 if you're too weak

### Stage 2
Get a streak: full win or loss streak without losing too much HP.

### Stage 4
Losses can be nasty because too many units.
Push level 7 on 4-1 if didnt do it before
Roll for 2*, specially 3-cost
Dont expect to 2* 4-cost units
