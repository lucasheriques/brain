## Code Smells

Code smells are key signs that refactoring is necessary. In the process of refactoring, we get rid of smells, enabling further development of the application with equal or greater speed.

The lack of regular refactoring, can lead to a complete paralysis of a project over time, wasting a few years of development and requiring you to spend several more years to rewrite it from scratch.

Therefore, it is necessary to get rid of code smells while they are still small.

## Bloaters

Bloaters are code, methods and classes that have increased to such gargantuan proportions that they are hard to work with. Usually these smells do not crop up right away, rather they accumulate over time as the program evolves (and especially when nobody makes an effort to eradicate them).
