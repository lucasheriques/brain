# Where to start

How to solve problems? We can divide that into five steps:

1. Understand the problem
2. List functional requirements
3. List possible solutions
4. Optimize your solution
5. Test your solution

## Understand the problem

Ask yourself: "do I understand what the problem is?". If not, clarify.

And do it. Some interviewers intentionally leave out some details to see tha ability to deduce wwhat information is incomplete or missing. A good idea maybe confirming the steps in your own words.

"I have a graph with a cycle in it and need to find the broken edge and remove it. Is this correct?"

If they say yes, move on to step two. Otherwise, ask for clarification.

## List the functional requirements
Listing the requirements (or things your solution has to include) will help you understand the problem, ensure you don't get sidetracked on different aspects of the problem, and identify missing information.

## List possible solutions
Are there any data structures to use? What are the drawbacks and benefits of each? Speak out lod.

Once you have two or three possibilities, choose the solution that you're most comfortable coding. If it's not the most performant, that's okay, but state that out loud.

Nothing wrong with coding a brute-force solution first and optimizing second.

## Optimize

If there's time, optimize. Move from a O(NË†2) to a (N log N) solution, for instance.

If there's no time, explicitly state that you recognize the solution isn't performant and you would have liked to refactor it to use merge sort or quick sort instead of bubble sort.

## Test your solution
Think abut edge cases. What happens with your code when it's passed an argument it didn't expect? Does it break? If so, refactor.

# What to do if you get stuck
Be honest with your interview. Something in the lines of: "I know I need to do X but I'm not sure how to proceed."

Your interviewer most likely wants you to succeed. Therefore they'll be happy to give you a hint or two along the way or overlook an important aspect of the problem.

Stay calm, take a drink of water.
