Instead of trying to predict what is important to my boss / boss's boss / boss's boss's boss setting up a 1:1 to ask them. Especially if I think I'm onto something important that they would care about. Before I sink a huge amount of time into a problem / proposal:

1.  Does X matter to you? (Is my pitch compelling already? What additional data do I need to collect to quantify the opportunity size? What size of problems make it onto your radar?)
2.  If so, what's your reaction to solving X through Y? (Is my solution compelling? What additional options do I need to consider? What might I be missing at org / business-wide context level?)
3.  What do you want / need from me to progress this idea towards execution as a next step? What specific details are important for you to see in the deliverables? (How can I progress this as efficiently as possible and without missing the mark on what you need to sponsor this?)
