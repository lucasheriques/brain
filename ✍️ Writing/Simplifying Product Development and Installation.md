# 00:01 Building a Product that Scales into a Company

In this section, the speaker talks about how to build a product that scales into a company. He explains that it is common for people to start with the product when starting a company and discusses how to turn the product idea into something that can be scaled into a big company.

## Starting with Product vs Market

-   00:07 The speaker asks if anyone started their thinking with a product as opposed to starting with an industry where they understood a problem and decided to explore different products.
-   00:27 Most people start by thinking about the product instead of the market. The speaker explains that this is not necessarily bad but it doesn't always scale into a big company.

## Designing Products from the Get-go

-   00:47 The speaker talks about designing products from the beginning by building in things like go-to-market strategy and pricing. This helps turn the product idea into something that can be scaled into a big company.

## Minimum Viable Product vs Product Market Fit

-   01:42 The speaker talks about minimum viable products and product-market fit, explaining that while they are important, they are not enough to build a lasting company.
-   02:01 When going out for series A funding, investors want to see more than just product-market fit. They want to see revenue and at least one minimum viable segment for which the product works.

# 02:20 The Product Company Gap

## The Challenge of the Product Company Gap

-   02:34 The speaker introduces "The Product Company Gap" and explains that it is a challenge to take a product idea and turn it into something that can be deployed at scale in the marketplace.
-   02:52 He shares his experience of starting Padient, a mobile payments company, and how they tried to address this gap by going after huge retailers like Best Buy and Walmart.

## Designing for Product Go-to-Market Fit

-   03:11 The speaker talks about designing products for go-to-market fit, which involves making them easier to sell.
-   03:32 He explains how Padient failed because they didn't realize how hard it was to get an IT department at big retailers to deploy their technology.

## Conclusion

-   03:49 Although Padient had good core technology, it never turned into a huge company. The speaker emphasizes the importance of crossing "The Product Company Gap" in order to build a lasting company.

# 04:43 The Importance of Monetization and Go-to-Market Strategy

This section discusses the importance of monetization and go-to-market strategy in building a successful product company. It uses the example of YouTube's acquisition by Google to illustrate how having a great product is not enough to succeed.

## The Success of YouTube

-   04:43 Prior to being acquired by Google, YouTube was one of the fastest-growing sites on the internet with 20 million users per month.
-   In less than two years, they were acquired by Google for $1.65 billion.
-   The platform was falling down before the acquisition due to lack of an economic model and high running costs.

## Monetizing Products

-   05:03 To succeed, companies need to figure out how to monetize their products.
-   YouTube figured out how to monetize through advertising, making it a $30 billion business within the Google ecosystem.
-   Having a great product is not enough; companies need to think about pricing and go-to-market strategies.

## The iPhone as an Example

-   05:57 Steve Jobs is considered one of the greatest product managers ever because he focused on design and aesthetics.
-   The iPhone's success was due not only to its hardware form factor but also its App Store and in-app purchases.
-   Companies should focus on customizing their products for customers while also considering pricing strategies.

# 07:32 Scaling a Software Company: Development vs Sales & Marketing

## Simplifying the Problem

-   20:06 Simplify the problem by focusing on one channel, one department's budget, and a simple product use case.
-   The center of the Venn diagram is your MVS cluster of demand.

## Proving Your Idea Works

-   20:58 It's not about revenue at this point; it's about showing that your basic idea works and that you can repeatably sell it.
-   Find a couple of customers who want to take this product and then find five more who look just like them.
-   If you can do this, then you have something.

# 22:08 Example from Portfolio: The Ploy
