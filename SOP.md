# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Lock-Out Tag-Out Program

## Scope

This document applies to all employees, contractors, and vendors who work in or interact with any equipment or machinery at the manufacturing plant. This SOP must be followed for equipment maintenance, cleaning, repair, and any other activities that might expose personnel to hazardous energy sources.

## Purpose

The purpose of this SOP is to:

- Ensure the safety and well-being of all individuals working in or around the manufacturing plant.
- Protect workers from hazardous energy sources during equipment maintenance and repair operations.
- Comply with industry regulations, provincial laws, and company standards for operating the manufacturing plant.

## Abbreviations / Definitions

- **LOTO**: Lock-Out Tag-Out
- **Authorized Employee**: A person who is approved to perform tasks that require LOTO procedures
- **Affected Employee**: A person whose work operations are directly affected by the LOTO process
- **Energy Isolating Device**: A mechanical device that physically prevents the transmission or release of energy

## Responsibility

- **Plant Manager** is responsible for ensuring that this SOP is implemented and enforced at the manufacturing plant.
- **Supervisors** are responsible for ensuring that authorized employees follow this SOP and have received adequate training.
- **Authorized Employees** are responsible for following this SOP when performing tasks that require LOTO procedures.
- **Affected Employees** are responsible for adhering to this SOP and respecting the LOTO devices applied by authorized employees.

## General Procedures

1. **Preparation**: Authorized employees must identify all possible hazardous energy sources associated with the equipment or machinery before starting the LOTO process.
2. **Notification**: Inform all affected employees about the LOTO process, the reasons for it, and the estimated duration of the shutdown.
3. **Shutdown**: Turn off the equipment or machinery using the normal stopping procedure.
4. **Isolation**: Locate and isolate all energy sources associated with the equipment or machinery using appropriate energy isolating devices.
5. **Lockout and Tagout**: Apply LOTO devices to the energy isolating devices. Each authorized employee involved in the task must attach their own lock and tag to the LOTO devices.
6. **Verify Zero Energy State**: Ensure that all energy sources have been effectively isolated and controlled by attempting to start the equipment or machinery. If successful, no energy should be present.
7. **Perform Maintenance / Repair**: Complete the required maintenance or repair tasks while the equipment or machinery is in a locked and tagged-out state.
8. **Restore Equipment to Operational State**: Remove LOTO devices, in the reverse order of their application, only after ensuring that all maintenance tasks have been completed, and all affected employees are informed.
9. **Notification**: Notify all affected employees that the LOTO devices have been removed, and the equipment or machinery is ready to be operated.

## Special Procedures

In situations where multiple authorized employees are working on the same piece of equipment, a group LOTO procedure must be implemented. This involves having a designated coordinator who is responsible for ensuring that all steps in the LOTO process are properly followed and communicated to all authorized employees.

## Training

All authorized employees must receive LOTO training before being allowed to perform tasks that require LOTO procedures. Training should include:

- Review of this SOP
- Identification of energy sources and energy isolating devices
- Proper use of LOTO devices
- Steps to follow during the LOTO process

Affected employees should also be trained to recognize the purpose and importance of LOTO devices and the consequences of attempting to operate locked out equipment.

## Enforcement

Failure to follow this SOP may result in disciplinary actions, up to and including termination. It is the responsibility of supervisors and management to enforce the adherence to this SOP and ensure a safe working environment for all employees.
