# Stack
Think a stack of books. Last in, first out.

## Benefits
Constant-time adding and removing the top item.

## Downsides
Don't offer constant-time access to the nth item in the stack, unlike an array.

## Methods
- `pop()`: removes the top item from the stack (and usually return it)
- `push(item)`: adds an item to the top of the stack
- `peek()`: return the item at the top of the stack
- `isEmpty()`: returns true if the stack is empty
- `get length()`: returns the number of items in the stack
