There are two types of Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Base LLM
Predicts next word, based on text training data

```md
Prompt: Once upon a
```



## Instruction Tuned LLM

think of giving instructions to another person

when a LLM doesn't work, sometimes it's because those instructions were not clear enough

# Guidelines

some principles and tactits to apply when working with LLMs:
## Write clear and specific instructions

You should express  what you want a model to do by providing instructions that are as clear and specific as you can possibly make them. Clear =/= short. In many cases, writing longer prompts provide more clarity and context for the model, which can actually lead to more detailed and relevant outputs.

### Tactic 1: Use delimiters


1. Give the model time to think
