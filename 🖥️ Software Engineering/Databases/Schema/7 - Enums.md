**TLDR: Enums in MySQL are a powerful feature that can simplify database design, increase security, and improve readability. With a predefined list of allowable values for a column, the benefits of enums are clear. However, it's also important to keep in mind the limitations and potential drawbacks of using enums, such as the need to alter the schema if allowable values change. Overall, if used correctly, enums can be a valuable tool when working with string data in MySQL.**

Enums have lots of advantages: readability of a string, little bit of data validation and storage-level of integers.

However, they do have some drawbacks:

1. sorting are made with the underlying integer value.
2. you can't add another option without changing the whole schema.

please don't ever use integer enums, just use a `TINYINT` column.


Fixed number of options that don't really change is the best use case for enums.
