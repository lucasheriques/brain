senior engineer is the first position on an engineering ladder where you also have to be a leader.

biggest reason people struggle with this position is that they conflate leadership with management.

senior developr is the first position that has leadership. 

leaders set a diretion and rally their team to that destination. managers are concerned with the execution.

if you choose management over leadership, you will think that doing a good job breaking down tasks, being clever, and keeping folks accountable during standups is what senior devs do. They do that, but the critical piece is that they set direction.



First trait: technically deep and delivers.

First trait: leadership.

Second trait: rejection of hyperbolic discounting. 

Third trait: growing other people.

Sometimes you can get promoted for being at the right place at the right time. However, we are going to focus on the things that you can actually control.

Four universal traits of senior engineers:

Three things people do that get in the way:
1. Biggest reason people struggle with this promotion is because they conflate leadership with management. Senior devs is the first position that is considered a leadership position. You tipically do not have any direct reports.

Leaders set a direction and rally their team to that destination. Managers are concerned with the execution. Leaders can be managers, but managers are not leaders by default.

### An example

Suppose you're on a team that owns a backend service and need to deliver a critical API for a large project with a deadline in a month. A prototype for the call was done with a script, and you realize that the latency for this call is astronomical. Let's say the medium latency is 10s. And this is at or slightly above the threshold for what is acceptable.

An example of leadership would be to do a deep dive and propose that the API should be an asynchronous one where the API surface turn into a submission of work and fetching of status and outputs of drops. This sort of pivot makes the deadline a bit more challenging, but sets your team up for the future as you expect the latencies to increase as extensions are added to the initial functionality. You sell this idea to your team and management. When folks push back, you listen to them and give persuasive data-driven arguments like how a rewrite after delivery will cost more and lead to more operational burden. Maybe your team does not have a good track record of going back and doing things the right way, and there is a large backlog of other items in your roadmap. You write a quick design document and tech spec, break down the tasks and ensure the project is delivered on time despite the extra scope. You communicate the new direction to adjacent teams and they have enough time to integrate.

An example of management would be to realize the API will have high latency but you bias toward fixing it later because this delivery has high visibility and your name attached to it. You don't want to slip. You implement a clever technique to lower latency by 2s on the expected cases. You break the project into components that can be parallelized and follow up on standup to make sure everybody is doing their part. You get a technically deep team member to do a spike on how the API can be rewritten in the future and start to plan on how you will juggle the roadmap to find time to actually rewrite it. After you launch, of course.

If you choose management over leadership, you will think that doing a good job breaking down tasks, being clever, and keeping folks accountable during standups is what senior devs do. They do that, but the critical piece is that they set direction on top of execution. So, if you want to be a senior dev, you need to be opinionated about where your team should be going and your opinions need to be good. 

You can't just be a good coder or an effective scrum master. 

Usually SDEs are always concerned with getting more technical knowledge and to deliver bigger things with their name attached to it.

Being technically deep is a universal trait of senior engineers, but not sufficient for getting to the next level. These sort of responses are missing the point. All SDEs are technically deep and ship things. Technical chop and project management will only get you so far. For true tech depth, you need a layer of in leadership.

Being a leader means making tough decisions that may make the deadline more challenging, but ultimately set the team up for future success.

Technical chops and project management are like adding more cowbell to a song that has enough cowbell - true tech depth requires a layer of leadership.

Tech promotions are anti-peter principle, meaning promotions are conservative and only given to those who are already demonstrating the traits of the next level.
