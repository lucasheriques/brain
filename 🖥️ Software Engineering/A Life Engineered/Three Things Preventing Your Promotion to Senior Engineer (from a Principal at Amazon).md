senior engineer is the first position on an engineering ladder where you also have to be a leader.

biggest reason people struggle with this position is that they conflate leadership with management.

senior developr is the first position that has leadership. 

leaders set a diretion and rally their team to that destination. managers are concerned with the execution.

if you choose management over leadership, you will think that doing a good job breaking down tasks, being clever, and keeping folks accountable during standups is what senior devs do. They do that, but the critical piece is that they set direction.

If you want to be a senior dev, you need to be opinionated about where your team should be going and your opinion should be good. 

You can't just be a good coder or an effective scrum master. Being technically deep is a universal trait of senior engineers, but not sufficient for getting to the next leve.
