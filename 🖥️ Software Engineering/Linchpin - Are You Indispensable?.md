> No one is a genius all the time, but all of us are geniuses sometimes. Abundance is possible, but only if we can imagine it and then embrace it. It’s not about what you’re born with, it’s about what you do. The only way to get what you’re worth is to stand out, to exert indispensable, and to produce interactions that organizations and people care deeply about.


An artist is someone who uses bravery, insight, creativity, and boldness to challenge the status quo. And an artist takes it personally.

Art is a personal gift that changes the recipient. The medium doesn’t matter. The intent does.

Art is a personal act of courage, something one human does that creates change in another.

Passion is a desire, insistence, and willingness to give a gift.

**I don’t believe that you’re born to do a certain kind of art, mainly because your genes have no idea what technology is going to be available to you. Cave painters, stone carvers, playwrights, chemists, quantum-mechanic mechanics – people do their art where they find it, not the other way around.**

**Passion isn’t project-specific. It’s people-specific. Some people are hooked on passion, deriving their sense of self from the act of being passionate.**

Artists are optimists. The reason is simple: artists have the chance to make things better.
