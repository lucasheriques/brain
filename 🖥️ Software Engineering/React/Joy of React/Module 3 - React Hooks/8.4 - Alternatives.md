Often, by focusing on Application structure, we can make it either unnecessary to use `useMemo` hook or we can think of alternative strategies that might be simpler.

We hear a lot of lifting state up, but sometimes, the better approach is to *push state down*. Each component should have a single responsibility.

However, this won't always be an option, especially on real-world applications. In a large app, there's lot of state that *needs* to be lifted up pretty high, and can't be pushed down.

Evaluating your tools and knowing when to apply each one is incredible valuable. A couple of examples when talking about memoization:

- `useMemo` can be used to avoid recalculating an expensive computation. However, maybe you can wrap the whole component that does that on `React.memo`, and then you're memoizing the entire component, instead of just the expensive value.
- Making sure that each component only has the state that is relevant to them, to avoid having to lift state up, which can trigger a re-render for everyone on the tree.
