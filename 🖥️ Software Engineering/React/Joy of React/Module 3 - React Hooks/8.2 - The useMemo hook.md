The fundamental idea with the `useMemo` hook is that it allow us to *remember* a computed value between renders.

It is generally used for performance optimizations. Can be used in two separate-but-related ways:

1. We can reduce the amount of work that needs to be done in a given render.
2. We can reduce the number of times that a component is re-rendered.

# Use case 1: Heavy computations

Imagine we have an application like this:

```js
import React from 'react';
import format from 'date-fns/format';

import useTime from './use-time';

function App() {
  const [selectedNum, setSelectedNum] = React.useState(100);
  const time = useTime();
  
  // Calculate all of the prime numbers.
  // (Unchanged from the earlier example.)
  const allPrimes = [];
  for (let counter = 2; counter < selectedNum; counter++) {
    if (isPrime(counter)) {
      allPrimes.push(counter);
    }
  }
  
  return (
    <>
      <p className="clock">
        {format(time, 'hh:mm:ss a')}
      </p>
      <form>
        <label htmlFor="num">Your number:</label>
        <input
          type="number"
          value={selectedNum}
          onChange={(event) => {
            // To prevent computers from exploding,
            // we'll max out at 100k
            const num = Math.min(
              100_000,
              Number(event.target.value)
            );
            
            setSelectedNum(num);
          }}
        />
      </form>
      <p>
        There are {allPrimes.length} prime(s) between 1 and {selectedNum}:
        {' '}
        <span className="prime-list">
          {allPrimes.join(', ')}
        </span>
      </p>
    </>
  );
}

function isPrime(n){
  const max = Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(n));

  if (n === 2) {
    return true;
  }
  
  for (let counter = 2; counter <= max; counter++) {
    if (n % counter === 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
}

export default App;
```

`useTime` is a hook that is called every 1 second to update the time.

Since we're re-rendering the component every 1 second, it means we're unnecessarily re-calculating the prime numbers even if the input have not changed.

To skip this, we can use the `useMemo` hook.

```js
const allPrimes = React.useMemo(() => {
  const result = [];

  for (let counter = 2; counter < selectedNum; counter++) {
    if (isPrime(counter)) {
      result.push(counter);
    }
  }

  return result;
}, [selectedNum]);
```

`useMemo` takes two arguments:

1. A chunk of work to be performed, wrapped up in a callback function
2. A list of dependencies

During mount, when the component is rendered for the first time, React will invoke this function to run all this logic, calculating all of the primes. Whatever we return from this function will be assigned to `allPrimes`.

For every subsequent render, React has a choice to make. Should it:

1. Invoke the function again, to re-calculate the value, or
2. Re-use data it already has, from the *last* time it did this work.

To answer this question, it looks at the dependency array. If any of them changed since the previous render, it'll rerun the supplied function. Otherwise, it'll skip all that work and reuse the previously cached value.

**useMemo is essentially a lil' cache, and the dependencies are the cache invalidation strategy.**

In this case, we're saying "recalculate the list of primes *only* when `selectedNum` changes". When the component re-renders for other reasons (e.g. the `time` state variable changing), `useMemo` ignores the function and passes along the cached value.


## Similarities to other stuff
### useEffect
The main differences from `useMemo` to `useEffect` is that `useMemo` is used to calculate a value *during render*. Effects, meanwhile, invoke the callback function *after* the render, to synchronize React state with some sort of external systems.

### React.memo

They both do similar things.

- `React.memo` memoizes the result of *rendering a component*, only re-running when props change.
- `useMemo` memoizes the result of a *computation*, only re-running when the *dependencies* change.

# Use case 2: Preserved references

When you pass as a prop an object or array, you're not passing the values itself, you're passing the reference.

And, when you re-render a component, it means you're computing a whole new array/object.

So, if you use a `PureComponent` using `React.memo`, if you're passing an array/obj, even if none of the values changed, that memoized component is going to re-render regardless, because the object reference will change.

This is something we talked about in the [“Immutability Revisited” lesson](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/joy-of-react/03-hooks/03-immutability). When it comes to objects and arrays, it's not enough for them to _look_ the same. They have to _be_ the same. Both variables need to point to the same entity held in the computer's memory.

To avoid that, you can use `useMemo` so the reference does not change if none of the values on the dependency array changed.
