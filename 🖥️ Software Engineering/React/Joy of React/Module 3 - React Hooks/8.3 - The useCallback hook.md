`useCallback` solves the same `preserved reference` problems as `useMemo`, but for `functions` instead of arrays / objects.

Similar to arrays and objects, functions are compared by `reference` and not by `value`. 

```js
const functionOne = function(){ return 5; };
const functionTwo = function(){ return 5; };

console.log(functionOne === functionTwo); // false
```

This means that if we define a function within our components, it'll be re-generated on every single render, producing an identical-but-unique function each time.

`useCallback` servers the same purpose as `useMemo`, but it's built specifically for functions. We hand it a function directly, and it memoizes that function, threading it between renders.

```js
// This:
React.useCallback(function helloWorld(){}, []);

// ...Is functionally equivalent to this:
React.useMemo(() => function helloWorld(){}, []);
```
