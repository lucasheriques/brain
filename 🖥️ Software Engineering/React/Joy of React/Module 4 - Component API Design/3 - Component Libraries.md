Using a UI framework is useful in limited use cases (prototyping, internal tools), but they're not well-suited to production applications.

TLDR: **very few tech companies actually rely on these tools**. You need to write out your own first-party component library.

# Design Systems

A design system is what gives a brand its unique identity. It's a collection of rules that govern how a product looks, feels and behaves. It includes tokens for colors and typography styles, as well as in-depth designs for specific UI elements.

# Application Structure

All components go in a the folder `src/components`.
